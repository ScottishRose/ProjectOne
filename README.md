## Unsolved Problems

I couldn't get the modal working how I wanted it to be working. I am not really sure where I was going wrong. I would like to re-vist the code when I can. I also could not figure out how to reset the game by clicking the button instead of reloading the page. I am also not completely content with the style of my game but I spent too long fiddling with the JS and ran out of time. 

## What next?

I would like to come back to my game and add some things, such as playing against the computer or another player!
